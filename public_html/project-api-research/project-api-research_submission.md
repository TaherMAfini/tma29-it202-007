<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Explain what data you'll be using from the API and how you plan to use it in the project</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I will use the match results data (id, date, teams, score, championship/league) and<br>the championship standings gathered by using one of the match endpoints (viewMatchesBasic, dayMatchesBasic,<br>byMatchesBasic) and viewChampionship endpoint and will allow for filtering based on the championship<br>or team involved. Each user will be able to favourite the teams they<br>want to follow and their results will be displayed on the user specific<br>page. Users can also favorite champions to see their standings on the user<br>page. Certain users will also be able to add another entry for a<br>match which will also update the championship standings (Not sure if this will<br>be added since refresh of data can wipeout modifications due to user addition<br>of matches).<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> API Info</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The quota for the API is 200 calls/day with a rate limit of<br>4 requests per second. I will most likely refresh the data once or<br>twice per day and maybe add an option for a manual refresh that<br>can be triggered by certain users.<br></p><br></td></tr>
